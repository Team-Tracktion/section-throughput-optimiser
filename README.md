1. Build the "Brain" (The Optimization Algorithm)
Input: Real-time data (train positions, speeds, delays, track availability).

Process: Create an algorithm that processes this data against a set of hard constraints (safety rules, track physics, signaling) and soft constraints (train priorities, schedules).

Output: A conflict-free movement plan. This is the core of your solution. It must answer: "Which train goes first at junction X?" and "Where should Train Y wait for Train Z to pass?"

2. Make it Dynamic and Real-Time
Your system cannot be a one-time planner. It must constantly re-calculate the optimal plan as new data comes in (e.g., a train breaks down, there's a sudden delay).

It must re-optimize quickly (within seconds or minutes) to be useful to a controller.

3. Create a Simple User Interface (UI) for Controllers
Show the Recommendation: Clearly display which train should proceed, halt, or be rerouted.

Show the "Why": Provide a simple reason for the recommendation (e.g., "Allow Freight Train 123AB to pass first due to higher priority").

Allow Manual Override: Controllers are in charge. There must be a button for them to ignore the AI's suggestion and log a reason why.

4. Develop a "What-If" Simulator
This is a key feature. Allow the controller to ask: "What would happen if I held this train for 5 minutes?" or "What if I route this train through Platform 2 instead of 1?"

Your system should simulate the outcome and show the potential effects on overall delay and throughput.

5. Integrate with Data & Show Results
Data In: Design how you would connect to real railway data feeds (APIs for signaling, timetables, GPS). (For the hackathon, you can use simulated or sample data).

Data Out: Create a dashboard showing KPIs like Punctuality, Average Delay, and Track Utilization to prove your system's effectiveness.
